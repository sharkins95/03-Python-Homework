For the PyBank assignment, I wrote a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company provided in a CSV.

My script determines:

<br>-The total number of months included in the dataset</br>
<br>-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period</br>
<br>-The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period</br>
<br>-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period</br>
<br>-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period</br>

In the PyPoll assignment, I wrote a Python script to analyze the mock election results of a small town provided in a CSV.

My script determines:

<br>-The total number of votes cast</br>
<br>-A complete list of candidates who received votes</br>
<br>-The percentage of votes each candidate won</br>
<br>-The total number of votes each candidate won</br>
<br>-The winner of the election based on popular vote</br>
