For the PyBank assignment, I wrote a Python script to analyze the financial records of a company provided in a CSV.

My script determines:

-The total number of months included in the dataset
-The net total amount of "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The average of the changes in "Profit/Losses" over the entire period
-The greatest increase in profits (date and amount) over the entire period
-The greatest decrease in losses (date and amount) over the entire period

In the PyPoll assignment, I wrote a Python script to analyze the mock election results of a small town provided in a CSV.

My script determines:

-The total number of votes cast
-A complete list of candidates who received votes
-The percentage of votes each candidate won
-The total number of votes each candidate won
-The winner of the election based on popular vote
